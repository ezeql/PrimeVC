/**
 * Abstract Façade class.
 * 
 * The Façade is responsible for initializing in order:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Event-Signals           </li>
 * <li> Model-Proxies           </li>
 * <li> App states collection	</li>
 * <li> Controller-Commands     </li>
 * <li> and View-Mediators.     </li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Facade initializes the main parts of the application 
 * (model, view, controller) and provides a main access point for them.
 * Acting as a binding component it allows to separate the model from
 * the view, thus separating data from UI elements respectively. 
 * 
 * @modified May 10, 2011, Ruben Weijers
 * 		Added application-states to the facade.
