 * SimpleStateMachine is another implementation of the FiniteStateMachine 
 * design-pattern but simpler. It doesn't use State objects to define the
 * state but just uses enum values to change the currentState.
 * 
 * Instead firing 3 signals when the state changes (exiting old state, changing
 * states) there will be only one event, the change event.
